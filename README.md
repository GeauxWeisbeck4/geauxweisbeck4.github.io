My official digital garden, curated and nurtured on my favorite knowledge-management-notes-human-mind tool ever. LogSeq is so money. I also use Roam. And Obsidian. And Dendron. 

I use all the tools baby.

## TO GET STARTED WITH LOGSEQ + THESE NOTES TEMPLATE 

- Download LogSeq here! 
- Click on Make a template button for this repository
- Git clone in your terminal of choice
- Open LogSeq and click on New Graph -> Then choose a folder
- Click the folder you git cloned in your file explorer -> Then click on the geauxweisbeck4-digital-garden-template -> Right click and renane the first folder in their title my_digital_garden -> Click on the open button
- Enjoy!

### You can also just click into the first folder and use that if you want to include my massive digitial garden 

There is a lot of awesome stuff in there - I'd recommend this option if you want a fun learning experience. I wouldn't be surprised if I read more than any other human on this planet.
